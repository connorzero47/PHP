		<h3>What tasks you have not attempted or not completed?</h3>
		<p>Despite the difficulty and challenges, I was able to attempt every task in this assigment which has improved my understanding of mysql and web development.</p><br>

		<h3>What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about?</h3>
		<p>I noticed that there was no indication in the requirements that if the user inputs an email or profile name that is already in the database will result as invalid,
		so I was able to create a statement where it will check the database for redundancy and output whether the email or profile name is already taken.</p><br>

	<section>
		<h3>Which parts did you have trouble with?</h3>
		<p>At first, I had a struggle on creating the table using php since everytime I refresh the index page, my sample users are created which causes redundacy. My solution
		to that was to create it once and leave it as a comment for reference since it is already created in my database and no longer requires another action to create it</p><br>

		<h3>What would you like to do better next time?</h3>
		<p>I have always struggled with my CSS skills since I lack the sense of creativity with my codes, but further improving that skill would benefit me as a programmer.</p><br>
